# Smart Motion Detection System (OpenCV + Background Subtraction + YOLO)

A real-time motion detection system built with Python and OpenCV.  
This project detects moving objects using background subtraction, removes noise using morphological filters, highlights motion regions with bounding boxes, and in this version combines YOLO-based human detection with the motion pipeline for smart alerts.
## Why?

This project is designed for scenarios like:
- Home security cameras
- Office monitoring after working hours
- Human-only alerts (ignore pets or small objects)

# This version includes:
- Real-time video processing  
- Area filtering to remove irrelevant motion  
- YOLO-based human detection combined with motion detection  
- Configurable parameters through YAML  
- Organized folder structure for scalability
